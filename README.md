# SoC-Musify
Musify : Music generation with A.I, the purpose of this project is to compose music using Python and its various libraries. We learnt about the basics of python, its functions, further we also went through the libraries of python such as Pandas, NumPy, and Tensorflow. It is so great that now we are able to create an original piece of music using just some code. We had a vast dataset to choose from the Midi files on kaggle. The experience was really good and I got to learn a lot of new things.  
# About the project
1. Platform : Visual Studio Code
2. Language : Python 3.8
3. Libraries Used : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
4. Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi 
# Structure of the project and important files
MOD/ : This directory conatins optimizer, metrics, and weights of our trained model.
Dataset used for the code/ : Dataset folder containing the midi files of different composers.
Code.ipynb : This is the code for the project where we build, train, and test our model.
AI_composed_musicfinal.mid : This is the music file
SOC| Learning Project | Musify | Janhavi.docx : This is the report and the documentation of my project.
SoC Presentation : This is a power point presentation which describes the idea , code and learning behind the project .
MusifyVideo : The video which I have made for the project describing the project .
# Steps for the code writing in VS Code
STEP 1 : Download the files from the repository by clicking on Code button
STEP 2 : Install Libraries using pip command (In Anaconda Prompt)
STEP 3 : Open code.ipynb file using Visual Studio Code
STEP 4 : Run all the cells one by one and check the output
STEP 5 : Wait for the model training as it takes a long time depending on the dataset used and various other factors.
STEP 6 : Run the last cell and a file named as AI_composed_musicfinal.mid will be saved
