# SoC-Musify
Musify : Music generation with A.I, the purpose of this project is to compose music using Python and its various libraries. We learnt about the basics of python, its functions, further we also went through the libraries of python such as Pandas, NumPy, and Tensorflow. It is so great that now we are able to create an original piece of music using just some code. We had a vast dataset to choose from the Midi files on kaggle. The experience was really good and I got to learn a lot of new things.  
Here I have mentioned all the sources used, code of my final project and the final output, that is the music that is been created:

I had completed the going through the learning sources till 10th July, and then started working on the code.
The dataset that I have used is given below :
